    <td colspan="2" class="detailnotes">This clock is of extremely high quality, the gilt-bronze mounts are
of the best fi nish, comparable to the clocks made by Robert Robin
for Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. It is a characteristic Robin clock
of the design launched by him in 1777, with a classic endless-rope
“remontoire egalité” mechanism which frequently rewinds the
weights to give a constant force to the escapement. Although the
present clock is signed Robin Fils and dated 1802, and therefore
belongs to the period of Robin’s son Jean-Joseph Robin, its design
is fi rmly rooted in the Louis XVI style and dating from only just after
the death of the elder Robin.
Equation of Time
With this type of Equation of Time display, the equation hand is
concentric with the minute hand. The difference between the mean
time and the solar time is shown by the “Sun" hand which revolves,
following or preceding the regular minute hand of the mean time.
Equation of time indicates the time difference between the true solar
day and the mean solar day (or time told by a clock or watch). It has
two major causes. The fi rst is that the plane of the Earth's Equator
is inclined to Earth’s orbital plane. The second is that the orbit of
the Earth around the Sun is an ellipse and not a circle. Equation of
Time due to Obliquity (the Earth's tilt). If the Earth's rotational axis
was not tilted with respect to its orbit around the Sun, the apparent
motion of the Sun along the Ecliptic would fall directly on the
Equator, covering the same angles along the Equator in equal time.
However, this is not the case, since the angular movement is not
linear in terms of time because it changes as the Sun moves above
and below the Equator. The projection of the Sun's motion onto the
Equator will be at a maximum when its motion along the Ecliptic
is parallel to the Equator (at the summer and winter solstices) and
will be at a minimum at the equinoxes. Equation of Time due to
Unequal Motion (the Earth's elliptical orbit). The orbit of the Earth
around the Sun is an ellipse. The distance between the Earth and the
Sun is at a minimum around December 31 and is greatest around July 1. The Sun's apparent longitude changes fastest when the Earth is closest
to the Sun. The Sun will appear on the meridian at noon on these two dates and so the Equation of Time due to Unequal Motion will then be
zero. The mean solar day, calculated by averaging all the days of the year, was invented by astronomers for convenience so that the solar day
would always be 24 hours. True solar time and mean solar time coincide four times a year, on April 16, June 14, September 1, and December 25.
On these days, the equation will equal zero. During the other 361 days, the equation of time must be used to indicate the difference between
the two times, amounting over 16 minutes at certain times of year. The minimum difference occurs on November 1 with a loss of 16 minutes and
23 seconds and the maximum occurs on February 11 with an increase of 14 minutes 20 seconds. This positive and negative value is offset in the
time of the local noon and those of sunrise and sunset. Equation of time, often represented by a fi gure eight, called an “analemma”, can be
approximated by the following formula: E = 9.87 * sin (2B) – 7.53 * cos (B) – 1.5 * sin (B) Where: B = 360 * (N-81) / 365 Where: N = day number,
January 1 = day 1.</td>
